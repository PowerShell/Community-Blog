## The Purpose of this blog

The intended purpose of this blog is to provide a platform for the PowerShell Community to show off the great things you can do with PowerShell.
The blog should be a set of simple steps to take, with PowerShell, to achieve some task.
Blog posts can cover either Windows PowerShell, or the open source PowerShell 7.
While we welcome deep, deep posts, most posts are likely to be at the 200-300 level.
In other words, great practical advice on how to solve real-world IT Professional problems, with a side-helping of technical depth.
This blog welcomes submissions to the blog both from internal Microsoft teams and external people.

Posts to the blog can discuss products and technologies that are not part of the core PowerShell product or even made by Microsoft, as long
as the post's content is relevant to PowerShell users and is not marketing those products.
