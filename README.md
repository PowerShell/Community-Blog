# PowerShell Community Blog

This repository is for submissions for posts to the
[PowerShell Community Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell-community). We welcome
submissions to the blog from anyone in the community.

Submissions for articles on this blog are governed by the
[Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/) or the
[.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct). For more
information, see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/).

## The Purpose of This Blog

The intended purpose of the PowerShell Community Blog is to provide a platform for the PowerShell
Community to show off the great things you can do with PowerShell. This blog welcomes submissions
to the blog both from internal Microsoft teams and external people. Blog posts can cover the open
source PowerShell 7 or Windows PowerShell. Your post should clearly outline the problem the being
solved. Your post can cover an advanced topic, but most posts are likely to be at the 200-300 level.
For advanced topics, consider splitting your subject into a multipart series of posts.

Posts to the blog can discuss products and technologies that are not part of the core PowerShell
product or even made by Microsoft, as long as the post's content is relevant to PowerShell users and
is not marketing those products.

The published language for the PowerShell community is English, and mainly American English,
although posts other variations of English are acceptable. The article review process focuses on the
language and structure of each article, as well as the specific details. Even if English is not your
first language, the review process can help to iron out any problems.

## How to Interact

There are several ways you can interact, depending on your needs and levels of enthusiasm.

1. The entry-level, so to speak, is to read the blog and enjoy the content. You can come
   [to the PowerShell Community Blog directly](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell-community)
   or use a blog aggregation mechanism to view the content. Over time, we hope and expect the major
   search engines to index these posts, making it easy for IT Pros to find and use the information
   contained.

1. You can also comment on any of blog posts directly on the blog. This blog uses WordPress, so in
   order to add comments, you need to create and then login to a WordPress account. Once you logon
   successfully to the blog, WordPress allows you to add comments to the posts here.

   See our [Community Blog Wiki pages](https://github.com/PowerShell/Community-Blog/wiki) for
   detailed instructions. We welcome comments and prefer them in English. You can use an online
   translator like [Bing Translator](https://www.bing.com/translator) if English is not your first
   language.

1. You may want to contribute to the development of blog posts. You can create new posts, file
   issues on any article (or proposed article), or help review content submissions. If you find an
   error, feel free to
   [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/Community-Blog/issues). You can also file
   an issue to suggest a specific topic you feel might make a good blog post.

You need a GitHub account to be able to submit anything to the blog's GitHub repository. You can
sign up for GitHub at [GitHub's new account sign up page](https://github.com/join?source=login).
And, you need to be able to use GitHub and, most likely, git on your workstation.
