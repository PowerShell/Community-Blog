## Contributing to the blog

The intended purpose of this blog is to provide a blogging platform for the PowerShell Community,
both internal and external to Microsoft's PowerShell team. Posts to the blog can discuss products
and technologies that are not part of the core PowerShell product or even made by Microsoft, as long
as the content is relevant to PowerShell users and is not marketing those products.

To get started, you must create a WordPress profile. Then you can create and submit your blog post.
See the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/PowerShell/Community-Blog/wiki) for detailed instructions.

Acceptance of any blog post is done at the sole discretion of the Blog admins. Before we can accept
a submission, you must sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This is a one-time event.
