# PowerShell Community Blog Repository

This repository is for submissions for posts to the
[PowerShell Community Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell-community). We welcome
submissions to the blog from anyone in the community.

Submissions for articles on this blog are governed by the
[Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/) or the
[.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct). For more
information, see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/).

## The Purpose of This Blog

The intended purpose of the PowerShell Community Blog is to provide a platform for the PowerShell
Community to show off the great things you can do with PowerShell and Windows PowerShell. Each
article should provide a set of (relatively!) simple steps to take, with PowerShell, to achieve some
task. Blog posts can cover either Windows PowerShell, or the open source PowerShell 7. While we
welcome deep, deep posts, most posts are likely to be at the 200-300 level. Posts should make clear
the problem the article helps the reader to solve. In other words, great practical advice on how to
solve real-world IT professional problems, with a side-helping of technical depth. This blog
welcomes submissions to the blog both from internal Microsoft teams and external people.

Posts to the blog can discuss products and technologies that are not part of the core PowerShell
product or even made by Microsoft, as long as the post's content is relevant to PowerShell users and
is not marketing those products.

The published language for the PowerShell community is English, and mainly American Ennglish,
although posts other variations of English are acceptable. The article review process focuses on the
language and structure of each article as well as the specific details. If English is not your first
language, or even if it is, the review process can help to iron out any problems.

## How to Interact

There are several ways you can interact, depending on your needs and levels of enthusiasm.

1. The entry-level, so to speak, is to read the blog and enjoy the content. You can come
   [to the PowerShell Community Blog directly](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell-community)
   or use a blog aggregation mechanism to view the content. Over time, we hope and expect the major
   search engines to index these posts, making it easy for IT Pros to find and use the information
   contained.

1. You can also comment on any of blog posts directly on the blog. This blog uses WordPress, so in
   order to add comments, you need to create and then login to a WordPress account. Once you logon
   successfully to the blog, WordPress allows you to add comments to the posts here.

   See our [Community Blog Wiki pages](https://github.com/PowerShell/Community-Blog/wiki) for
   detailed instructions. We welcome comments and prefer them in English. You can use an online
   translator like [Bing Translator](https://www.bing.com/translator) if English is not your first
   language.

1. You may want to contribute to the development of blog posts. You can create new posts, file
   issues on any article (or proposed article), or help review content submissions. If you find an
   error, feel free to
   [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/Community-Blog/issues). You can also file
   an issue to suggest a specific topic you feel might make a good blog post.
