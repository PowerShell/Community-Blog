# Get-Services, PowerShell 7 VS Windows PowerShell 5.1

**Q**: How can I get the Username, and StartType for a Windows Service?

**A**: Quick answer is PowerShell 7.

Microsoft is doing a great job on PowerShell with each version they release. The simple answer to this question is a command called `Get-Service`. But there is a big update that makes getting the required information much easier with PowerShell 7. I will show the result of this command using both **PowerShell 7** and **Windows PowerShell 5.1**.

Let's start by typing the simple command `Get-Service Workstation`. This command return basic details for a service called **Workstation**. The result is the same for both PowerShell 7 and Windows PowerShell 5.1.

```powershell
Status   Name               DisplayName
------   ----               -----------
Running  LanmanWorkstation  Workstation
```

To drill-down and get a more detailed result, we need to see all the associated *Property* and *Methods* for this service, which can be achieved by using the following command

## Getting Windows Services using Get-Service

```powershell
Get-Service Workstation | Get-Member 
```

The output will return a list of possible members that can be invoked in the command line

```powershell
**Powershell 7**

## PowerShell 7

The big difference is in the Property, now in Powershell 7, it's possible to read some additional properties that were not available in Windows PowerShell 5.1, such as **UserName, BinaryPathName, StartType.** So let's see how to read the **Username**, **BinaryPathName,** and **StartType** using PowerShell 7

```powershell
PS 7> Get-Service workstation | select  Username,Starttype,BinaryPathName
```

The output is a clear, with all the required result with one-liner native command.

```powershell
UserName                    StartType BinaryPathName
--------                    --------- --------------
NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService Automatic C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k NetworkService -p
```

## Windows Powershell 5.1

For Windows PowerShell 5.1, the operation is not straight forward, as such in PowerShell 7, we need to use the `Get-CimInstance` and pass the required WQL query, so in Windows PowerShell 5.1 run the following command

```powershell
WPS 5.1> Get-CimInstance -Query 'select * from Win32_Service where caption like "Workstation"' | select StartName,StartMode,PathName
```

```powershell
StartName                   StartMode PathName
---------                   --------- --------
NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService Auto      C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k NetworkService -p
```

As shown in the command, we invoke `Get-CimInstance` (or if you are using Get-WmiObject) and wrote a query to get the service name, and after that select the required properties, which is a long way and require to know extra information related to the original service name and some basic WMI query.

## Summary

More and more to come with PowerShell 7, ease of use, backward compatibility much rich experience. This post shows a small portion of a small change in PowerShell which will help a lot of admin in their day-to-day tasks.
