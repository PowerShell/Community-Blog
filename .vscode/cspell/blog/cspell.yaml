  This cSpell configuration is for terminology used on the Blog. Only add to the dictionary defined
  here if the terms aren't for general PowerShell. If they apply to PowerShell more broadly,
  contribute those changes back to the psdocs configuration and dictionaries in the
  MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs repository, not here.
