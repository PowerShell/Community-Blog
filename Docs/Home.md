# Welcome to the Community-Blog wiki!

The Wiki contains documentation on how to create a new blog post and how we operate this blog.

Participation in this blog is governed by the
[Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/) or the
[.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct). For more
information, see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/).

Making contributions to the blog is very similar to making contributions to docs.microsoft.com. To
get started, you the following things:

1. A WordPress account (see [Becoming a contributor](https://github.com/PowerShell/Community-Blog/wiki/Becoming-a-contributor))
1. A GitHub account
1. Familiarity with Markdown and VS Code
1. Familiarity with the GitHub workflow

If you need help getting started with GitHub or the Docs authoring process, see the _Set up and work
locally_ section of the public
[Contributor's Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/get-started-setup-github).

Formatting of the content should follow the same rules published in the
[PowerShell-specific Contributors Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/overview).
and the
[PowerShell Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/powershell-style-guide).

There are a few minor differences in the markdown used by docs.microsoft.com and our WordPress
blogging platform. Those differences are described in the
[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/PowerShell/Community-Blog/wiki/Markdown-cheatsheet) in this
Wiki.
