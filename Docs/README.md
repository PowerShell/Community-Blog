# Welcome to the Community-Blog contributor guide

The Wiki contains documentation on how to create a new blog post and how we operate this blog.

Participation in this blog is governed by the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct][1] or the

get started, you require the following things:

1. A WordPress account (see [Becoming a contributor][4])
1. A GitHub account
1. Familiarity with Markdown and VS Code
1. Familiarity with the GitHub workflow

If you need help getting started with GitHub or the Docs authoring process, see the _Set up and work
locally_ section of the public [Contributor's Guide][5].
