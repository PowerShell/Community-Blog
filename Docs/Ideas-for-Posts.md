# Ideas for a new post

## Share your experiences

Ideas for posts can come from anywhere, but the best posts come from your own experience. Think
about a time when you solved a unique problem using PowerShell or learned something new about
PowerShell. Personal stories make good content.

Blog posts should be your own original content. It's acceptable to reuse content you posted to
another blog as long as you own the rights to reuse that content.

## Update a post from the Scripting Blog

There is a lot of useful content on the old [Scripting Blog][1], but the information may be
incomplete, no longer accurate, or needs to be updated for the current version of PowerShell.

If you find a post on the old blog that you think could be updated, create a new issue using the
[Request update to old post from The Scripting Blog][2] issue template. Include the following
information:

- Link to the post in the old blog
- Description of what needs to be changed

Then you can start working on a rewrite or you wait for someone else to create an update.

## Look for issues labeled `up-for-grabs`

Anyone can submit ideas for new posts or requests for updates to existing posts, but not everyone is
ready to write that post. Issues that are labeled `up-for-grabs` are open to anyone who might be
interested in writing that post. You can get a complete list of these issues by
[filtering the view][3] on that label.

## Acceptable content ideas

The intended purpose of this blog is to provide a blogging platform for the PowerShell Community,
both internal and external to Microsoft's PowerShell team. Posts to the blog can discuss products
and technologies that aren't part of the core PowerShell product or even made by Microsoft, as long
as the content is relevant to PowerShell users and isn't marketing those products.

Acceptance of any blog post is done at the sole discretion of the Blog admins.

Acceptable posts meet one or more of the following criteria:

- Show how to use PowerShell to solve a specific problem or scenario
- Explain PowerShell usage in more detail than provided in the documentation
- Doesn't contain marketing materials or product announcements
  - Examples using non-Microsoft products and modules are allowed as long as the purpose is to
    demonstrate a solution
