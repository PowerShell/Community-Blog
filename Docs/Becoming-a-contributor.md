# Becoming a contributor

## Prerequisites

Before your post can be published, you need to have a WordPress account. Use the following steps to
create an account.

1. Open [https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell-community][1]
1. Click the Login button in the top-right corner of the page.
1. Login using one of the three options

   ![blog login][2]

1. Fill in the following information in your profile:
   - First and Last name
   - The Display name should be your full name
   - Add any social media links you wish to share (optional)
   - Add a brief Bio explaining who you are / what your PowerShell experience is
   - Add a profile picture (optional)

By default, your account is added as a **Subscriber** in WordPress. We will review your profile
before you can be elevated to **Author** status. Your WordPress account must have **Author**
permission before your post can be published.

## Getting started with GitHub and VS Code

If you need help getting started with GitHub or the VS Code for markdown authoring, see the
_Set up and work locally_ section of the public
[Contributor's Guide][3].

This guide includes steps for the following items:

1. [Creating a GitHub account][4]
1. [Installing Git, VS Code, and the Docs Authoring Pack][5]
1. [Setting up your local Git repository][6]
1. [Git and GitHub fundamentals][7]
1. [An explanation of the full GitHub workflow][8]

We also recommend installing the [posh-git][9] module from the PowerShell Gallery. This module makes
it easier to use Git from the PowerShell command line.
